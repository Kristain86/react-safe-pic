```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { SafePic } from 'react-safe-pic'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafePic
      regularImage={'your-jpg-png-image'}
      webpImage={'your-webp-image'}
    />
  )
}
```

## How it works and when to use it?

<p>React-safe-pic main job is to keep image compatibility in all browsers. </p>

<p>Also react-safe-pic it has 2 fallbacks to keep it safe and easy. If .WEBP fails it will load the JPG/PNG/SVG image, and if JPG/PNG/SVG image fails as well you can handle the error and showing a default error image! :D </p>

## Customize your picture?

<p>You can blur you image, rounded it, put it a mask (even a gradient one) and handle opacity. More feature will be added, stay in tune! </p>
